Inorder to run project, you need RichTextBox's latest control (which comes on Service Pack 4). And you need the Common Controls which are also part of Service Pack 4. 
This product does not work on NT5 correctly!!! Because of the command.com and dos version.
I will in the future add it to both versions.
Please visit, www.mindimagination.com for more information or to download the installation package (which will be with more features).
